# Learning Full-Stack JavaScript Development: MongoDB, Node, and React

The purpose of this repository is to maitain up-to date the exercises I'm doing while follow the course [Learning Full-Stack JavaScript Development: MongoDB, Node, and React on LinkedIn Learning](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/learning-full-stack-javascript-development-mongodb-node-and-react/).

##### Course details
Learn by doing! Learn full-stack JavaScript development by building a web application with MongoDB, Node.js, and React.js.

Learn how to use Node as a web server and an API server, how to consume data and build user interfaces with React, and how to read and write data with a MongoDB database. React allows you to build full-featured, data-driven applications faster and more efficiently than what is possible with JavaScript alone.

Samer Buna introduces modern JavaScript programming concepts, with an emphasis on functional methods and open-source tools. The lessons are almost completely hands-on, with live coding demonstrations that bring the concepts home.

##### Learning Objectives
- Using modern JavaScript features
- Configuring webpack and Babel
- Working with native Node modules
- Creating an Express server
- Working with React components and JSX
- Loading and working with test mock data
- Fetching data from a remote API
- Working with data in MongoDB
- Isomorphic rendering on the server
- Front-end routing and back-end routing
